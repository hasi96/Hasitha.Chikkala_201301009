Introduction :

          Today’s Citizens are responsible for tomorrow’s future.  The world’s progress into the future,  has to be driven by its intellectual minds driving passionately into the depths of wisdom, science and in understanding Nature. But, to make such  Intellectual minds of tomorrow, today’s kids and their progress has a great role to play. 
          However, kids today are totally lost in the path of understanding the virtual world and getting amazed by it. As the Virtual world has become equally ubiquitous, the younger generations have to start getting adjusted with it and becoming a part of it. Thus, in this process kids become more clever, responsive and informative than in the older times.  Hence, they are exposed to tons of Information and millions of Opportunities to learn new things.  These virtual opportunities can help kids learn benefit from it.

Overview :

          Kids of this generation are addicted to electronic devices, which became a headache for many parents. However, they fail to understand the growth in intellectual power of the kids as they operate complex devices with such ease. As this came into light, Programmers started designing games, cartoons and many  other applications which can help increase the intellectual as well as the moral values of the children. This project would be an attempt to categorically design such games for different age groups which can help children increase their Cognitive recognition ability, Social & Emotional Development, Speech & Language Development, and many more abilities.
