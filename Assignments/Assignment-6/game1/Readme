To play the game,

First select the level (beginner/medieval/expert)

Then as the words appear at random just drag the word and drop it into the right bucket(Singular/Plural) and get an alert("Correct") , then move to the next word and so on

The frame of the code can be used for developing other games like dragging and dropping synonyms or antonyms in the appropriate buckets and so on...:)
